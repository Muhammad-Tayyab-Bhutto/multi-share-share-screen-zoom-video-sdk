You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task instruction and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

For each response:
1. Analyze the current state based on any terminal output provided
2. Determine the next set of commands needed to make progress
3. Decide if you need to see the output of these commands before proceeding

Instruction:
Project Type: Web Application
Tech Stack: Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (v4), Node.js (for package management)
Key Libraries: @zoom/videosdk, jsrsasign, @tailwindcss/vite

Goal:
Create a Zoom Video SDK integration that supports video conferencing, multiple active screen shares, and cloud recording controls.

Detailed Requirements:

Project Setup:
- Initialize a new Vite project with TypeScript.
- Configure Tailwind CSS v4.
- Install @zoom/videosdk for video/audio/screen logic and jsrsasign for generating JWT signatures locally.
- Important: Include a coi-serviceworker.js file and link it in index.html to handle Cross-Origin Isolation (COOP/COEP) required by Zoom Video SDK.

Environment Variables:
- Use a .env file to store VITE_SDK_KEY and VITE_SDK_SECRET.

UI Layout (index.html & style.css):
- Create a clean, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS.
- Header: Title "Zoom VideoSDK Screenshare".

Controls Area:
- "Join" button (initially visible).
- "Leave" button (hidden until joined).
- "Share Screen" button.
- Cloud Recording Controls:
  - "Start Cloud Recording"
  - "Pause Recording"
  - "Stop Recording"
  - (All hidden until joined)

Video/Screen Areas:
- Two containers:
  - share-container (screen shares)
  - video-player-container (camera feeds)
- Hidden <video> and <canvas> elements for local screen sharing previews
  (id="my-screen-share-content-video").

Grid Styling:
- Implement CSS specifically for video-player-container to create a responsive grid.
- Adjust columns (1, 2, or 3) based on the number of participants or shares.

Core Logic (src/main.ts):

Initialization:
- Create and initialize the Zoom Video SDK client using ZoomVideo.createClient().

Authentication:
- Implement a generateSignature function using jsrsasign.
- JWT Details:
  - Topic: "TestOne"
  - Role: 1

Joining:
- On "Join" click:
  - Generate the token.
  - Join the session.
  - Start audio and video.

Video Rendering:
- Listen for peer-video-state-change.
- Render remote user videos into video-player-container.
- Handle video removal when a user stops video.

Screen Sharing:
- Local Share:
  - Implement startShare using mediaStream.startShareScreen.
  - Prefer video element rendering, fallback to canvas.
- Remote Share:
  - Listen for peer-share-state-change.

Multi-Share Limit:
- Track active screen shares using a Set.
- Limit rendered screen shares to 4.
- If a 5th share starts:
  - Log the event.
  - Do not render it in the DOM.

Cloud Recording:
- Use client.getRecordingClient() to:
  - Start cloud recording.
  - Pause/Resume recording.
  - Stop recording.
- Update button states and labels dynamically
  (e.g., toggle "Pause Recording" / "Resume Recording").

Refinements:
- Implement proper cleanup in leaveCall:
  - Detach video views.
  - Remove DOM elements.
  - Leave the session.
  - Clear local state.
- Handle browser SharedArrayBuffer requirements via the service worker.

Your response must be a JSON object that matches this schema:

Don't include markdown formatting.

Note that you operate directly on the terminal from inside a tmux session. Use tmux keystrokes like `C-x` or `Escape` to interactively navigate the terminal. If you would like to execute a command that you have written you will need to append a newline character to the end of your command.

For example, if you write "ls -la" you will need to append a newline character to the end of your command like this: `ls -la\n`.

One thing to be very careful about is handling interactive sessions like less, vim, or git diff. In these cases, you should not wait for the output of the command. Instead, you should send the keystrokes to the terminal as if you were typing them.

The current terminal state is:
